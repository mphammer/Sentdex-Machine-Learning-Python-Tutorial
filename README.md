# Machine Learning Tutorial Python Introduction by Sentdex

## Description of This Repository

I followed along with the [Online Machine Learning Tutorial Introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/) by Sentdex. 
This repository contains the coding examples from the course. 

To make the code easier to follow for myself I have re-named variables, moved code blocks, added comments, and added functions. Despite this, the general flow of the course remains the same if you click through the lessons. 

I also made fixes to the coding examples due to libraries deprecating methods and/or renaming things.  

Note: This repository only stores the code. There is a lot more useful information, tips, and tricks mentioned in the actual course videos/notes.  

I hope that this repository can help you decide if you want to take the course for yourself.

## My Review 

This course is not good for learning theory but it's great for starting to get your hands dirty with code. 

The lessons are easy to follow and very cool since you use real datasets.  

Before taking this course I think it would be useful for someone to know the very basic ideas behind the ML algorithms covered and to understand the basic of Machine Learning (ex: you need training and test datasets; what a model is; etc.). The instructor also indicates that the user should know some basics of numpy and pandas, and I agree with that.
